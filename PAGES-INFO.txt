by copying from previous messages or using the code blocks:

SOLUTION:
---------
These files will be provided in PART 3 ZIP or as separate code blocks.
You can also reference previous messages in this conversation where
complete code for each page was provided.

For now, focus on:
1. Installing Part 1 (Logos + Layout fix)
2. Setting up Payload CMS 3.0 (this package)
3. Then add pages from Part 3

Total deployment can be done in 3 stages:
- Stage 1: Logos + Header fix (Part 1) ✅
- Stage 2: Payload CMS setup (Part 2 - this) ⏳
- Stage 3: Pages + Translations (Part 3) ⏳
